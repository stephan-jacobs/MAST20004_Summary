# MAST20004_Summary: A summary sheet for an introductory probability course

This repo contains the latex file for a summary sheet for MAST20004 - Probability at the University of Melbourne.

As you'll see at the end of the sheet, I used Dave Richison's excellent latex cheat sheet as a template.

If you want his original, you [can find it here](https://divisbyzero.com/2011/08/17/a-quick-guide-to-latex/)

If you want to use my sheet as the basis for your own, feel free to just copy it or fork the repo. 

If there's some gross error in my sheet you can submit an issue as well :)
